## Front matters

-  For this workshop we assume you know R and Rstudio and have used Rmarkdown before.

-  In this tutorial, we will
    1.  introduce Quarto and how to build a simple personal website using Quarto and hosting the page on [GitHub](https://github.com/)
    2.  introduce blogdown with a live-demo to build a quick blogdown template website and deploy it on [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

## What is Quarto?

.purple[.bold[Quarto]] is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system built on [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/)


--

.purple[.bold[Quarto]] is the **next generation of RMarkown**.

--


Publish high-quality .black[articles], .red[reports], .blue[presentations], .green[websites], .yello[blogs], and .orange[books] in HTML, PDF, MS Word, ePub, and more.

--

.purple[.bold[Quarto]] can author documents in plain text formats (**rmarkdown**, **markdown**) or mixed formats (**Jupyter** notebook) - .bold[more than just Rmarkdown!]

## Why not WordPress, Medium etc

## Quarto websites

**Convenient:** Documents published as part of a website share navigational elements, rendering options, and visual style.

--

**Features:** Website navigation through a global navbar, a sidebar with links, or both. You can also enable full text search for websites.

--

Example website: https://kuan-liu.github.io/biostat3/

--

**Host:** can be published to a wide variety of destinations including .purple[**GitHub Pages**], .green[**Netlify**], .blue[**RStudio Connect**], etc. 

---
## Getting started

-  Be sure that you have installed the **Quarto** package

```{r eval=FALSE, tidy=FALSE}
install.packages("quarto")
```

-  Create a website

```
quarto create-project MySiteName --type website

```

-  create a blog

```
quarto create-project MyBlogName --type website:blog

```

-  or use RStudio \> New Project \> New Quarto Blog


<!-- -  You can download or fork the entire repo at  to start coding your own website! `r emoji::emoji("cheers")` -->

---

class: left, ut-pantone_lime

## Try this - create Quarto website project

-  Create a new RStudio project and select a new directory and Quarto website

-  specify directory name with your GitHub account name plus **.github.io**,  e.g., Kuan-Liu.github.io
    
-  Explore the directory


---

## Navigation & Structure

-  `_quarto.yml`, website configuration file
    -  provides website options such as website theme, navigation bar.
    
-  index.qmd, home page of the website

-  about.qmd, the about page of the website

-  styles.css, Custom CSS for website (for advanced coder)


---

## Rendering posts and building webiste

-   On a specific post, Render with RStudio \> Render
-   Build tab \> Render/Preview Website (try)

These will preview the entire website

-  "Freeze" is a feature to specify which file you would like to render at each built (fast & efficient building).

```
execute:
  freeze: auto  # re-render only when source changes
  
```
-  Add `freeze: auto` to the _quato.yml file

---

## Themes

-  My favourite two new themes: Zephyr and Quartz
  -  A list of build-in themes: https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-blog.html#themes

-  To change theme, modify the bottom of your website's `_quarto.yml`

``` yaml
format:
  html:
    theme: Zephyr
```


---

## About page templates

-  list of themes: https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-about.html

.pull-right[
### trestles
<img src="https://quarto.org/docs/websites/images/about-trestles.png" width="400px"/>
]


---

class: left, ut-pantone_lime

## Try this - customize the about page

-  create a subfolder in your working directory called "images" and put a thumbnail photo in this folder

-  now updating the about page title section with

``` yaml
about:
  template: jolla
  links:
    - icon: twitter
      text: twitter
      href: https://twitter.com/
    - icon: github
      text: Github
      href: https://github.com/
```


---
## Home page

-  The home (landing) page for this website by default is generated following the `index.qmd` file

-  We might want to feature about page as the landing page
    -  simply rename the qmd files about.qmd to index.qmd 
    -  and rename index.qmd to anther tab of your website, for example publication or research

---

class: left, ut-pantone_lime

## Try this - Adding icons to social account

-  You can add links to GitHub, Twitter, Google Scholar on the navigation bar with icon by updating the config file, `_quarto.yml`

``` yaml
  navbar:
    right:
      - href: index.qmd
        text: Home
      - icon: github
        href: https://github.com/my_user_name
      - icon: twitter
        href: https://twitter.com/my_user_name
```
---

## Blog posts

-  you can add a quarto page to host blog posts by creating a blog.qmd file where you will display your blog posts in a listing.

![](https://rstudio-conf-2022.github.io/get-started-quarto/materials/images/mockup-blog.png)
---

## Listing

-  There are three types of listing displays: default, table, and grid

.pull-left[

-  Grid

.pull-right[
-  Table

![](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/images/listing-table.png)

]
---

class: left, ut-pantone_lime

## Try this - creating a blog post

1.  create blog.qmd and specify in the title section

```---
listing:
  contents: posts
  type: default
---
```

2.  create a sub folder name it "posts", under "posts" create another sub folder name it "blog1"

3.  inside blog1 folder try Blank File \> Quarto document and name it index.qmd ([example](https://kuan-liu.github.io/blog.html))
    -  this index.qmd will host content of your blog!

---

## Publishing - GitHub

-  Use [GitHub Pages](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/github-pages.html) when the source code for your document or site is hosted on GitHub repo.
-  make sure to render your site (html files) in the docs folder
  -  in _quarto.yml specify `output-dir: docs`

-  **Try this:** 
    1.  Build your website and push to GitHub repo **github_account.github.io**
    2.  go to settings of the repo and select page. Specify Branch master and /docs and save!
    3.  Your site should be live at https://github_account.github.io.
